# Introducing Myself
Hi, I am Sungduk Cho and I am working as **AI researcher** at VUNO Inc.

I am contributing not only to the **overall ML research and development pipeline**, but also at the **end user/customer level**.

I am particularly interested in the **value of product for the users**, especially by **optimizing the pipeline** from research and development to deployment and management.
